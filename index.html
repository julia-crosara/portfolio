            <p>Julia Crosara worked as a graphic web designer on my team while I was Product Manager of Computer Services at Kinko's [Corporate Headquarters]. Julia interfaced with our back-end web design team and with the front-end strategists to
                very successfully
                fulfill graphic and technical requirements to both sides' complete satisfaction. She showed great capacity to understand user needs, and management and technical requirements, and produced the desired products without fuss in
                an extremely timely manner under great time constriction.</p>

            <p>She was extremely personable and easy to get along with. When handed significant handicaps in technical equipment, she was able to respond flexibly and without complaint. Often working from home, we were still able to build faith in
                her reliability as she met deadline after deadline with exacting and satisfactory output. In fact, when put in a significant disadvantage by having to redo work of a previous artist and bring the team back on schedule, she responded
                gracefully and successfully to the challenge.</p>

            <p>It was a great pleasure working with Julia. I heartily recommend her to potential entrepreneurial clients due to her professionalism, trustworthiness, reliability, motivation and character.</p>

            <p>I am so grateful to have found Julia to create my website. I was so indecisive, had a vague vision of what I wanted and was all over the place. With Julia's background in art she was able to make sense out of all my babble and
                created
                the most beautiful, artistic website. It was a real pleasure to see my vague ideas came to life. She was so patient and so flexible to work with and always adaptable to all my new ideas. I got a lot of compliments regarding my
                floral
                design but I got more compliments for my website. I can highly compliment Julia!</p>

            <p class="pt-3">I love working with Julia Crosara! She’s talented, creative, curious, funny and totally professional.</p>

            <p>Equally important is what she is not – Julia Crosara is not a prima donna and she is not a flake. She gets the “big picture” quickly and understands & respects the realities a creative director is working with. Unlike many
                otherwise good designers, Julia is always part of the solution – never a
                whole new problem. And she never misses a deadline.</p>

            <p>Julia inspires me.</p>

            <p>I am so glad to have found her and – if you’re looking for an excellent designer who you can be happy to work with on your most important projects – I believe you will be too.</p>

            </div>

            <p class="pt-3">Julia is a fabulous graphics/web/print design artist. For years, I’ve been working to create a new logo for AssistU, and none of the graphics people I retained got the idea of what I wanted. Frustrated, I put it
                off
                for ages. I finally decided to talk with Julia and found in her a person who got me, my concept, and who has consistently worked proactively to help me redesign the logo to support my brand.</p>

            </div>

            <p class="pt-3">I was struggling to take my company to the next level. I needed a marketing makeover; new website, printed materials - everything. I was tired of spending money on fancy design work that didn't communicate my
                message.
                This time I wanted it to be perfect. Julia Crosara asked questions no
                one had ever asked me before. First she got to know me, then she got to know my company. Her first design draft took my breath away. She nailed it! After some minor tweaking, I have a graphic design that communicates my
                message
                perfectly and instantaneously. Thank you Julia, for taking me to the next level.</p>

            <p>If you've been looking for a designer that will over-deliver, look no further.</p>

            <p class="pt-3">I'm still constantly smiling as I update sections because this site is so beautiful. It really is just exactly what we needed and wanted. You do such beautiful work, and I'm glad we had someone design it who
                understands the organization and its mission. I think that really comes through in the design. It's just gorgeous, and I can't wait for the rest of the team to see it!</p>

            <p class="pt-3">Julia Crosara began working for me in 2001 and is still a great source of insight and direction for my company, Aware Toys. In 2001, my company was in the start up position and required a logo, marketing
                materials,
                illustrations for a children's book, and a web site. Julia had all of the abilities required to market our new product, along with many other talents.</p>

            <p>Julia took the time to listen and learn about my business and future goals. The work she produced was professional, timely, and brought together all aspects of the creative marketing person I was looking for to develop my
                ideas
                and concepts. Although we work at a distance, the relationship we have developed will continue, due to her being honest, reliable and communicative.</p>

            <p>I give Julia my highest recommendation and know she will continue to support and creatively develop many other businesses.</p>
